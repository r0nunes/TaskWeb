## TaskList Automation
This is my first automation with Ruby. For BDD, I used Cucumber, for interation UI Capybara and for PageObject I used SitePrism.

For integration continuous, I used Codeship (https://app.codeship.com/projects/228990) 

## How to use

- Open terminal service
- Acess TaskWeb/Cucumber directory and execute:

`
cucumber
`
